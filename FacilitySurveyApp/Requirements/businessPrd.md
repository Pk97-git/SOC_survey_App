Facility Survey App 

Project Summary for Operations Head 

Date: 

February 5, 2026 

Department: 

Operations 

 

The Problem 

Currently, our Ops team faces significant inefficiencies when conducting pre-project facility surveys: 

Team visits facility and takes photos during inspection 

Returns to office and manually enters data into Excel 

Photos must be manually organized and inserted into reports 

1-2 day delay between site visit and report completion 

High risk of errors, missing data, and lost photos 

 

The Solution 

A mobile app (iOS/Android) that enables surveyors to complete surveys on-site and generate Excel reports instantly. The app's output is a formatted Excel file—exactly like your current template but generated automatically.

How It Works 

Select Location & Department: User selects facility location and department. This information will be used for Excel report naming (e.g., 'FacilityName_Department_Date.xlsx') 

Choose Project Type: Select survey type (Facility Management, Drilling, Oil Waste Management, etc.) 

Complete Survey On-Site: Answer questions and take photos directly in the app as you inspect 

Review & Submit: App validates responses and flags any missing information 

Generate Excel Report: One click creates the Excel file with location and department in the filename. This Excel is the final deliverable—no other reports or formats 

Download & Share: Download the Excel to your device, then share via email, WhatsApp, or save to file system 

 

Questions We Need Answered 

To build the right solution, we need your input on these key questions: 

Survey Structure: Are survey questions standardized or do they vary by project type? Can you share your current Excel template? 

Photo Requirements: Should photos link to specific questions? How many photos per survey? Should they be embedded in Excel or attached? 

Connectivity: Do facilities have reliable internet, or do we need full offline functionality? 

Access & Distribution: Who downloads reports—surveyor, manager, or admin? Should surveys be stored in a central database? 

Language: English only, Arabic only, or bilingual interface?
